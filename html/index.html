    <!-- Main paragraph about Naruto -->
    <p style="text-align: center; text-shadow: 2px 2px 10px red;">
        Naruto Uzumaki is a ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village with dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. <br>
        Despite being shunned as a child due to the Nine-Tails Fox sealed within him, Naruto's determination, hard work, and desire for recognition <br>
        drove him to become one of the strongest ninjas. He believes in forging strong bonds with his friends and never gives up on his dreams. <br>
        Naruto's journey is about overcoming adversity, self-discovery, and protecting those he cares about. With his iconic orange jumpsuit <br>
        and his signature jutsu, the Shadow Clone Technique and Rasengan, Naruto continues to inspire everyone around him.
